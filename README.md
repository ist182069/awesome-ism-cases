# GSI Weekly and Final Cases

My grade in this course was 20/20. 
I ended up getting invited to be one of the teaching assistants for this courses because of such an achievement. 
These cases were done on the 2nd semester of 2019/2020.

## What is this repository about?
In this repository I make available all my weekly reports which helped me get such grade.
All of these reports, with the exception of Case A, had a grade over 4.50/5.00.

## How I have organized it
In the directory "/Cases", naturally I present all the reports.
Followingly, in "/Dashboard" I present the dashboard that the Professors made available throughout the course. By opening the file "dashboard.png" you can check the grades of my reports. 

## About the case studies.
The reports are order by their respective week, Case A through Case I.
Be warry that the Professors of the course change the subject of the reports each semester.
However, many of the themes are the same and sometimes the questions are similar, if not the same.

## Final Case Study
I also present my final report, which was worth 20% of my final grade.
I haven't gathered the reports of my group project, but if you are interested in them send me a private message or type a comment asking for those.

## Concluding Remarks
Feel free to inspire yourself or straight up copy and paste what I offer you.

Cheers my fellow colleages.
